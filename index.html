    <h1>Merry Christmas, Amadeusz 🎄</h1>

    <p><strong>Merry Christmas, my Amadeusz 🎄</strong></p>

    <p>
    Spending my second Christmas with you already feels so special, my love so sweet 😘
    Looking back, 2025 has been a beautiful and meaningful year for us.
    It's a year filled with milestones, growth, love, and lessons.
    I started this year with my lovely man, and my heart has been full ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
    You were my constant motivation when I felt tired, unsure, or overwhelmed.
    You have always been my number one support system, and I will forever be grateful for that 😘🥰
    </p>

    <p>
    June and July will never be remembered by me just as the peak of the rainy season 😉
    They will always be remembered as the months when my heart felt the warmest because of our honeymoon.
    </p>

    <p>
    The moment I saw you at the airport, there was no rush of overwhelming emotions,
    no nervousness — just peace and comfort.
    And when you hugged me for the first time… my love, it truly felt like home.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our first night being side by side is one of the most precious nights of my life.
    </p>

    <p>
    It was passionate.<br>
    It was intimate.<br>
    And it was pure, sweet, and full of respect.
    </p>

    <p>
    In that moment, I realized I could love you even more than I already did 😌🤭
    </p>

    <p>
    Seeing you sleep peacefully beside me every morning melted my heart in ways I can’t explain.
    You are the sweetest and most genuine man I’ve ever known,
    and I want to wake up to that face for the rest of my life, baby 😊
    </p>

    <p>
    Our honeymoon was the best month of my life so far.
    </p>

    <p>
    We walked through chaotic cities.
    We explored the flowing waters of the Agos River and felt the rain in the mountains of Sierra Madre.
    We flew across islands and blue skies, dived into clear seas,
    and embraced the quiet silence of the mountains in my hometown.
    </p>

    <p>
    Every place felt more beautiful because I was with you.
    </p>

    <p>
    This year wasn’t easy for us either.
    </p>

    <p>
    We faced personal battles we needed to win on our own.
    There were plans that led to misunderstandings,
    moments when emotions ran high,
    and fights that tested our patience and love.
    </p>

    <p>
    But despite all that, we stayed.
    We chose to understand, to communicate, and to grow… together.
    And I believe that’s what truly matters.
    </p>

    <p>
    As I look forward, my love, I feel hopeful and excited.
    </p>

    <p>
    I look forward to a future where we finally close the distance,
    where goodbyes turn into everyday hellos,
    and where love no longer has to rely on screens and time zones 🥺
    </p>

    <p>
    I look forward to building a life with you…
    one step, one plan, one dream at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please always remember this:
    </p>

    <p>
    I love you deeply.<br>
    I love you genuinely.<br>
    I love you even on the hard days.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thank you for being my safe place, my partner, my home…
    even from miles away.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Merry Christmas, my love so sweet! 🎄💗</strong></p>
